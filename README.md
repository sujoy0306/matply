# matply

`matply` is a simple, concurrent matrix multiplication library (upto two dimensions) written in Go. The main motivation behind this library is to learn concurrent programming and make this as efficient as possible. I am also following this [tutorial](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/go-concurrent-programming), so this would be a fun little assignment too.
